# Ionic

Simple tables for console output for C++.

Currently Windows, but Linux and OSX coming soon.

Ionic is a simple library for outputting tables to the console. It can print
in color, do linebreaks, align text, and supports several output styles.
Ionic is simple; it doesn't have a lot of features, but it's easy to use, and
runs reasonably efficiently.

Ionic is similar to Tabulate (https://github.com/p-ranav/tabulate) but it is
much simpler, both in code and features.
